### **Summary**
   | **Petroleum**
Consumption of petroleum products is increasing every year.With the series of tests in lab correct processing methods is adopted since varying proportion of Crude petrol is found in different source of Petroleum .Separation of the pure petroleum into different products  is done  and all the  products are  used for special purposes.Fractional distillation,main method of separation, separates according to their boling temperatures.Pipe-still is popular though batch-stills is still done.Pipe-still allows continous vaporisation and rectification of the fractions.Crude oil is pumped in a special tube in which it is heated and vaporises partially.Vapour is condensed by coming into contact with previously evolved fromvapour  in the fractionation tower.
